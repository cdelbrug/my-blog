  <description><![CDATA[Introduction Hey all,
This is the study guide I&rsquo;ve been building since I started studying for this exam way back in 2017. I&rsquo;ve renewed it 4 times now so I have a pretty good grasp of what is going to be on it and what study materials to use. Hopefully it can help fill any gaps you may have. I&rsquo;ve sourced the material from solution articles, experience, and manuals.
About the Exam The test itself is very challenging.]]></description>
